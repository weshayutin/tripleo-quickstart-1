# Include settings from the libvirt role, and include all the
# `setup/*` roles.  This means that when your playbook has:
#
#     roles:
#       - libvirt/setup
#
# You also get:
#
# - `libvirt/setup/user`
# - `libvirt/setup/overcloud`
# - `libvirt/setup/undercloud`
dependencies:
  - role: libvirt
  - role: setup/user
  - role: setup/overcloud
  - role: setup/undercloud
